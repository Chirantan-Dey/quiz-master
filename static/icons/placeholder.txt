You need to create two icon files here:

1. icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)

These should be your app logo at different sizes. For now, you can use any simple icon or create one with a tool like Figma, Adobe XD, or a free icon generator.

Example properties:
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Colors: Use your theme color (#563d7c)
- Content: Could be "QM" or a quiz-related symbol
